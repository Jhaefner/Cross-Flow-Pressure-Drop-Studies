Need to add issues:
1. Add the analytical solution of Khan et. al. "Convection Heat Transfer from tube banks in crossflow: Analytical Approach"
2. Add VDI Heat Atlas equations for pressure drop and heat transfer (These may already exist)
3. Add pressure drop correlations for packed beds for pebble bed reactor geometries
4. Add pressure drop across non-circular tubes in cross-flow such as ovals
5. Add test problem from example in VDI Heat Atlas 2nd Edition pg. 1082-84
6. Look into VDI Heat Atlas 2nd Edition L1 p. 1076 for a comprehensive review of cross-flow.
7. Add heat transfer correlation for helical coils
8. Need to remove the specific corrections from the dP_Zu function and make them general. Allow the user to decide if they want to use it or not.
9. Bias: Need to determine how the percent error was calculated and is it appropriate based off this information. â€“ Ask Jonah what exactly he did again.
10. Need to address calculating mean percent error (or other metric) based on log transformed values as opposed to based on non-transformed. To help prevent higher percent errors (or other metric) from heavily biasing the mean value.
11. Provide a text file with the data for comparison.
12. Find out what happened to the curve fits created for the first reference plus the recent student conference paper.
13. Add Prandtl number ranges for each correlations when available.
