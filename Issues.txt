Need to add issues:
1. Add the analytical solution of Khan et. al. "Convection Heat Transfer from tube banks in crossflow: Analytical Approach"
2. Add VDI Heat Atlas equations for pressure drop and heat transfer
3. Add pressure drop correlations for packed beds for pebble bed reactor geometries
4. Add pressure drop across non-circular tubes in cross-flow such as ovals
5. Add test problem from example in VDI Heat Atlas 2nd Edition pg. 1082-84
6. Look into VDI Heat Atlas 2nd Edition L1 p. 1076 for a comprehensive review of cross-flow.
7. Add heat transfer correlation for helical coils
